# Contributing to magi-cli

We love your input! We want to make contributing to magi-cli as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Follow the Code Pattern

Follow the established pattern used in commands. Here's what to include:

**Command Structure:**

- Use descriptive `Use`, `Short`, and `Long` fields
- Provide clear usage examples
- Include comprehensive help text
- Follow the pattern of having subcommands when appropriate
- Implement a default behavior when no subcommand is specified

**Example from crypto command:**
```go
var newCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "new-command",
    Short: "Short description",
    Long: `Detailed command description.

Available subcommands:
  subcommand1     Description of subcommand1
  subcommand2     Description of subcommand2

Usage:
  magi new-command [command]

Examples:
  # Default behavior
  magi new-command

  # Using some subcommand
  magi new-command subcommand1

Run 'magi new-command [command] --help' for more information on a specific command.`,
    Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
        // Default behavior implementation
    },
}
```

### Command Documentation

Ensure the command includes:

- Clear and concise descriptions
- Information about subcommands
- Default behavior explanation
- Usage examples

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update the docs/ directory with any new documentation
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/MagdielCAS/magi-cli/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/MagdielCAS/magi-cli/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
